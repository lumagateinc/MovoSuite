![016](../images/cfg_email_temp_options.png)

**FIGURE 16**. Email Template task selection

- **App Request Received**. When a user requests an app that requires Admin approval, and clicks **Submit Request**, they will receive a message confirming their request was received.
- **Deployment Approval Request**. When a user requests an app that requires Admin approval, these settings will format the approval request e-mail to the email-enabled group you specify in the Email Notifications section.
- **Deployment Completed**. When the deployment request is complete, this message will be sent to the requesting user.
- **Deployment Started**. When an app deployment begins, this message will be sent to the email address of the user requesting deployment.
- **Purchase Request Approval**. When a user requests a new app to be purchased and added to their catalog, this message will be sent to the **Procurement Requests** email address.
- **Purchase Request Completed**. When someone at the **Procurement Requests** email address completes the app purchase and marks the request as complete.

**STEP 2: Customize the Template**: The default template for that function you chose will be presented right below the list, as shown in Figure X, Customize the template customize using free text and variables shown at the bottom of the template. Supported variables are:

| Variable | Description  |
|----------|-----------------------|
|  %appName  | Display name of the app referenced in the request.   |
|  %requestId  |  The ID number of the request  |

> **Note**: MovoSuite sends a command for each device after approval and initial batch of non-approved apps, rather than waiting for the devices to report back before sending the email. The message is sent only after the last app in the list has been provided.  

#### Generate the Office 365 Provider ID<!-- omit in toc -->

While still in the Email configuration area, we will generate the Office 365 Provider (Originator) ID. This establishes a trust foundation for Outlook to fetch the latest information for the email from MovoSuite for notifications related to app approval and app procurement workflows. 

1. You will click the **Create Provider ID** button. This will take you to the [**Actionable Email Developer Dashboard**](https://outlook.office.com/connectors/oam/publish) where you can generate this ID. You will need the three items listed under the textbox in Figure 17. 

    ![018](../images/cfg_email_origid.png)

   2.3. **Additional Information**:

4. Once you have generated the ID, an email notification will be sent to the Exchange administrators of your organizations to approve. If you are a Global Administrator or Exchange Administrator, you can approve the pending ID from the admin view of the **Actionable Email Developer Dashboard** [here](https://https://outlook.office.com/connectors/oam/admin).
5. Save the **Provider ID (originator)** from the **Actionable Email Developer Dashboard** into MovoSuite, and save the change.
