## Prerequisites<!-- omit in toc -->

Before configuring MovoSuite, you should have the following items in place.

- **#1 - Contributor rights to an Azure subscription or Resource Group**. Have at least Contributor rights to an Azure subscription or Resource Group within the subscription.
- **#2 - Have access to a Global Administrator account**. The Global Administrator account is used for authorizing MovoSuite to perform deployment and notification actions, as well as approving Office 365 Provider ID (also known as Provider ID). If you do not have access to a Global Administrator account, you will need access to accounts with at least:
  - The ability to consent to an application for delegated and application permissions. [See here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/custom-consent-permissions) for more information on creating a custom role to do this.
  - Exchange Administrator role for approving the Provider / Provider ID.
- **#3 - Intune with DEP and VPP integrated**. MovoSuite builds on and enhances native Intune functionality, so you will need Intune deployed integrated with your Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) and Volume Purchase Plan (VPP). MovoSuite supports unlimited VPP tokens up to the Intune maximum.
- **#4 - Create an Exchange Online mailbox for sending email notifications**. This should be a User Mailbox (requires an account with an Exchange Online license) or a Shared Mailbox (no license required), but cannot be an Office 365 Group mailbox due to limitations in Microsoft Graph today.
- **#5 - Identify an email address for receiving notifications/requests**. Ideally, this should be an **Office 365 Group**, with members subscribed to emails in order for Actionable (live) emails to work. Shared/resource mailboxes will not render the Actionable emails, and fall back to basic HTML). Alternatively, specify an individual user email address.

### General<!-- omit in toc -->

![001](images/cfg_gen_all.png)

**FIGURE X**. Configuration - General

#### Self Service<!-- omit in toc -->

##### Enable App Catalog Procurement Form 
 
 This option is enabled by default, but can be turned off. It shows or hides the Request App navigation entry.

##### Require Exact Match for Device Lookup

This option is **deprecated**, and will be removed in the future as it has been replaced by native support for Intune Role Based Access Control (RBAC).

##### Enable RBAC

When you check the Enable RBAC box under **Configuration \> General**, MovoSuite filters the apps and devices shown to users in the self-service areas based on their permissions in Intune. You should enable Self-Service Tags and Groups if enabling this option, so that MovoSuite can create Scope Tags for each location, and groups for granting assignment.

##### Enable Self-Service Tags and Groups

If enabled, MovoSuite will provision an Intune role named **MovoSuite - Self Service** and associated self-service groups and assignments for each MovoSuite location. The permissions granted in this role are as follows:
- Managed Apps (Read and Assign)
- Mobile Apps (Read and Assign)
- Managed Devices (Read)
- Remote Tasks (Sync devices)

##### Enable Field Tech Tags and Groups

If enabled, MovoSuite will provision an Intune role named **MovoSuite - Field Tech** and associated field tech groups and assignments for each MovoSuite location. The permissions granted in this role are as follows:
- Managed Apps (Read and Assign)
- Mobile Apps (Read and Assign)
- Managed Devices (Read)
- Remote Tasks (Sync devices)

##### Use Two Stage Approval

If enabled, MovoSuite will send a second email to the global email address registered for deployment or purchase requests if a delegated approver (e.g. school principal) has approved the request.

##### Hide Billing Code

If enabled, MovoSuite will not show the billing code field in forms.

##### Billing Code Placeholder

Change the placeholder text for billing code fields to guide your users.

##### Timezone

Configure the site-wide timezone. This is used when rendering times in emails, request history, and event logs.

#### Other<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Admin Group<!-- omit in toc -->

There are two approaches to managing administrator access in MovoSuite:
- Azure AD **role assignment**
- Administrator **group assignment**

The preferred way to manage administrator access in MovoSuite is via Azure AD **role assignment**. MovoSuite roles in Azure AD are:
- **Self-Service User**. This user will be able to deploy apps, but will NOT see the **Configuration** tab in MovoSuite.
- **Administrator**. Users in this role have full permissions in MovoSuite, and see all MovoSuite settings

To add user or group to MovoSuite roles in Azure Active Directory:

![001](images/cfg_gen_rbac.png)

**FIGURE X**. Adding Users or Groups to MovoSuite RBAC Roles

If not using MovoSuite Azure AD roles, you can choose to use **Administrator Group** assignment. Create a group for your MovoSuite administrators, and then select the group from the dropdown under **Admin Group**.

#### Apple App Store Country Code<!-- omit in toc -->

The App Store country code selection is used to specify the locale for fetching app metadata. It defaults to CA (Canada).

#### Group Name Prefixes<!-- omit in toc --> 

[back to ToC](#table-of-contents) | [back to checklist](#install-and-configuration-checklist)

### Notifications<!-- omit in toc -->

*To configure notifications, perform the following steps:*
1. Configure Sender Email Address
2. Configure Approval Recipient Email addresses
3. Configure Office 365 Provider ID
4. **Optional**: Configure Webhook Notifications For Microsoft Teams

#### Notifications Sender Email<!-- omit in toc -->

Configure the Sender Email address field with the email address of a User Mailbox or Shared Mailbox existing in Exchange Online. Office 365 Group Mailboxes cannot be used for the sender address.

![001](images/cfg_email_send.png) 

**FIGURE X**. Sender Email Address

#### Notifications Recipient Emails<!-- omit in toc -->

There are three email addresses for backend administrative items. You may use an email-enabled group address for any of these notifications, shown in the figure below.

![001](images/cfg_email_notif.png) 

**FIGURE X**. E-mail Notification and Message Format

#### Webhook Notifications<!-- omit in toc -->

You can configure notification of approval requests (deployment or purchase) to Microsoft Teams via webhook. These notifications are actionable, which means you can approve or decline the approval request right within your Teams channel!

To configure actionable webhook notifications:

1. Open Microsoft Teams and select the team you would like to receive notifications.
2. Click the ellipsis (...) next to the team name and select **Manage team**.
3. Select the **Apps** tab.

#### E-mail Templates <!-- omit in toc -->

Configuring your email templates is a simple 2-step process:

**STEP 1: Select the Action**: Select the action for which you wish to configure the e-mail template, shown in Figure X and described in the list below.

![001](images/cfg_email_temp_options.png)

**FIGURE X**. Email Template task selection

- **App Request Received**. When a user requests an app that requires Admin approval, and clicks **Submit Request**, they will receive a message confirming their request was received.
- **Deployment Approval Request**. When a user requests an app that requires Admin approval, these settings will format the approval request e-mail to the email-enabled group you specify in the Email Notifications section.
- **Deployment Completed**. When the deployment request is complete, this message will be sent to the requesting user.
- **Deployment Started**. When an app deployment begins, this message will be sent to the email address of the user requesting deployment.
- **Purchase Request Approval**. When a user requests a new app to be purchased and added to their catalog, this message will be sent to the **Procurement Requests** email address.
- **Purchase Request Completed**. When someone at the **Procurement Requests** email address completes the app purchase and marks the request as complete.

**STEP 2: Customize the Template**: The default template for that function you chose will be presented right below the list, as shown in Figure X, Customize the template customize using free text and variables shown at the bottom of the template. Supported variables are:

| Variable | Description  |
|----------|-----------------------|
|  %appName  | Display name of the app referenced in the request.   |
|  %requestId  |  The ID number of the request  |
|  %requestStatus  | Status the request (e.g. In progress, Complete, Failed)  |

**IMPORTANT**: Click **Save** to save your changes to the template you are working with BEFORE choosing another!

![001](images/cfg_email_temp.png)

**FIGURE X**. Email Template configuration area

[back to ToC](#table-of-contents) | [back to checklist](#install-and-configuration-checklist)

> **Note**: MovoSuite sends a command for each device after approval and initial batch of non-approved apps, rather than waiting for the devices to report back before sending the email. The message is sent only after the last app in the list has been provided.  

#### Generate the Office 365 Provider ID<!-- omit in toc -->

While still in the Email configuration area, we will generate the Office 365 Provider (Originator) ID. This establishes a trust foundation for Outlook to fetch the latest information for the email from MovoSuite for notifications related to app approval and app procurement workflows. 

1. You will click the **Create Provider ID** button. This will take you to the [**Actionable Email Developer Dashboard**](https://outlook.office.com/connectors/oam/publish) where you can generate this ID. You will need the three items listed under the textbox in Figure 17. 

    ![001](images/cfg_email_origid.png)

    Figure X. The Office 365 Provider ID

2. You will now provide answers to the following items:

   2.1. **New Provider**:
      - Friendly Name: MovoSuite
      - Sender email address: _**the sender email address from Actionable Emails section (unchangeable)**_
      - Provider URL: _**target URL from Actionable Emails section**_

   2.2. **Scope of submission**: Organization

   2.3. **Additional Information**:
      - Other email addresses: Email addresses of others who should be notified about MovoSuite license renewal. 
      - Comments: "Email notifications from MovoSuite for Intune"

3. At the bottom of the form, check the box labeled "I accept the terms and conditions…" and then click Save.
4. Once you have generated the ID, an email notification will be sent to the Exchange administrators of your organizations to approve. If you are a Global Administrator or Exchange Administrator, you can approve the pending ID from the admin view of the **Actionable Email Developer Dashboard** [here](https://https://outlook.office.com/connectors/oam/admin).
5. Save the **Provider ID (originator)** from the **Actionable Email Developer Dashboard** into MovoSuite, and save the change.

### Integration (bulk admin)<!-- omit in toc -->

The Integration Settings area of the MovoSuite interface includes:

- **Asset Integration**. This feature enables ingestion of additional information (such as asset tag numbers for matching serial numbers) for shared iPad devices directly from service desk or Excel data sources.  
- **Naming Authority**. This feature enables automated naming of shared iPads in Intune using the device naming format you specify under **Naming Conventions**.
- **Naming Conventions**. This feature enables customization of the naming of shared iPads in Intune, including location short codes or asset tag numbers.

Configuration steps for these features are detailed below.

### TO-DO<!-- omit in toc -->

*How do we assign a user a catalog specific to their location?*
e.g. - A catalog for teachers at school X.

*Which tasks do you expect users will be least able or totally unable to do on their own?*

*What if I don't configure RBAC?*
Just use the Admin group

*Where did Device Name Format go? (General tab)*
Now on the integration tab, configurable per-location

*Spreadsheet template for the Excel import?*
Docs have enough guidance on this I think.
