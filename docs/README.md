## Prerequisites<!-- omit in toc -->

Before configuring MovoSuite, you should have the following items in place.

- **#1 - Contributor rights to an Azure subscription or Resource Group**. Have at least Contributor rights to an Azure subscription or Resource Group within the subscription.
- **#2 - Have access to a Global Administrator account**. The Global Administrator account is used for authorizing MovoSuite to perform deployment and notification actions, as well as approving Office 365 Provider ID (also known as Originator ID). If you do not have access to a Global Administrator account, you will need access to accounts with at least:
  - The ability to consent to an application for delegated and application permissions. [See here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/custom-consent-permissions) for more information on creating a custom role to do this.
  - Exchange Administrator role for approving the Provider / Originator ID.
- **#3 - Intune with DEP and VPP integrated**. MovoSuite builds on and enhances native Intune functionality, so you will need Intune deployed integrated with your Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) and Volume Purchase Plan (VPP). MovoSuite supports unlimited VPP tokens up to the Intune maximum.
- **#4 - Create an Exchange Online mailbox for sending email notifications**. This should be a User Mailbox (requires an account with an Exchange Online license) or a Shared Mailbox (no license required), but cannot be an Office 365 Group mailbox due to limitations in Microsoft Graph today.
- **#5 - Identify an email address for receiving notifications/requests**. Ideally, this should be an **Office 365 Group**, with members subscribed to emails in order for Actionable (live) emails to work. Shared/resource mailboxes will not render the Actionable emails, and fall back to basic HTML). Alternatively, specify an individual user email address.

There are three email addresses for backend administrative items. You may use an email-enabled group address for any of these notifications, shown in the figure below.


**FIGURE X**. E-mail Notification and Message Format

#### E-mail Templates <!-- omit in toc -->

Configuring your email templates is a simple 2-step process:

**STEP 1: Select the Action**: Select the action for which you wish to configure the e-mail template, shown in Figure X and described in the list below.

![001](images/cfg_email_temp_options.png)

**FIGURE X**. Email Template task selection

- **App Request Received**. When a user requests an app that requires Admin approval, and clicks **Submit Request**, they will receive a message confirming their request was received.
- **Deployment Approval Request**. When a user requests an app that requires Admin approval, these settings will format the approval request e-mail to the email-enabled group you specify in the Email Notifications section.
- **Deployment Completed**. When the deployment request is complete, this message will be sent to the requesting user.
- **Deployment Started**. When an app deployment begins, this message will be sent to the email address of the user requesting deployment.
- **Purchase Request Approval**. When a user requests a new app to be purchased and added to their catalog, this message will be sent to the **Procurement Requests** email address.
- **Purchase Request Completed**. When someone at the **Procurement Requests** email address completes the app purchase and marks the request as complete.

**STEP 2: Customize the Template**: The default template for that function you chose will be presented right below the list, as shown in Figure X, Customize the template customize using free text and variables shown at the bottom of the template. Supported variables are:

| Variable | Description  |
|----------|-----------------------|
|  %appName  | Display name of the app referenced in the request.   |
|  %requestId  |  The ID number of the request  |
|  %requestStatus  | Status the request (e.g. In progress, Complete, Failed)  |

**IMPORTANT**: Click **Save** to save your changes to the template you are working with BEFORE choosing another!

> **Note**: MovoSuite sends a command for each device after approval and initial batch of non-approved apps, rather than waiting for the devices to report back before sending the email. The message is sent only after the last app in the list has been provided.  

#### Generate the Office 365 Originator ID<!-- omit in toc -->

While still in the Email Notifications section, we will generate the Office 365 Originator ID. This establishes the foundation for how MovoSuite will send notifications related to app approval and app procurement workflows. 

1. You will click the Create ID button. This will take you to the "Actionable Email Developer Dashboard" screen in the Azure portal where you can generate this ID. You will need the three items listed under the textbox in Figure 17. 

    ![001](images/cfg_email_origid.png)

### TO-DO<!-- omit in toc -->

*How do we assign a user a catalog specific to their location?*
e.g. - A catalog for teachers at school X.

*Which tasks do you expect users will be least able or totally unable to do on their own?*

*What if I don't configure RBAC?*
Just use the Admin group

*Where did Device Name Format go? (General tab)*
Now on the integration tab, configurable per-location

*Spreadsheet template for the Excel import?*
Docs have enough guidance on this I think.
